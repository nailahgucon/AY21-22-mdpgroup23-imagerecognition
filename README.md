# CZ3004 Multidisplinary Project - Image Recognition

Experimented with 2 models, YOLOv4-tiny  and YOLOv5

**My Dataset**
- Images and text files with annotations: https://www.kaggle.com/nailahgpgucon/
- Annotation Tool used: https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg (Download binary file found in Releases Section)

**Training the Model** 

Depending on your choice of YOLOv4 and YOLOv5, Roboflow provides a Google Colab notebook that helps to train your model.

*Reason for choice: It's much easier to use as you do not have to install any dependencies and do not require an NVIDIA GPU. However, there's a GPU limit, and hence based on my experience, training can only be done 3-4hrs a day.*
